        <p>For generations, politicians have been slipping giveaways to their home districts into unrelated bills, which is called Pork.
          But hey, no reason you can&#39;t extend service to your friendly lobbyists. Allow tighter pig pens in an energy bill, or loosen banking regulations in a bill making it easier for 6-year-olds to open carry at school.</p>

        <p>When you work for multiple lobbies, sometimes you just need to get creative. Place the pork token on any token on the board (even a pesky constituent) and then make a match near them. The pork token gets scooped up with the match, freeing up more space on the board.</p>
        <img src="assets/help-images/pork.gif" />
        <p>This can be especially helpful in the case of one token getting trapped among tokens for another lobby.</p>
