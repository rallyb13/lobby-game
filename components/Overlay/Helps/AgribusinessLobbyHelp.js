        <p>The Agribusiness Lobby works much like the Oil Lobby. Match three patented (and non-reproducing) seeds together and you get a corn token.</p>
        <p>The corns combine to make some fat cattle, which combine to make slaughter houses, which combine to make Fat Food restaurants.</p>
        <p>The Fat Food joints don&#39;t have to be placed together. Once you have enough, you&#39;ll earn a Favor from the Agribusiness lobby.</p>
        <p>Use the Corn Syrup/Itis to hold those pesky constituents in place for ten moves when you really need them to stay out of your way. Over-eating can make them lethargic.</p>
